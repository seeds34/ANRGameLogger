ANR Game Logger is an Android app designed to allow the user to log games of Android Netrunner they have played and any notes they have about the game. The original idea of the app came from the believe that the best way to get better at the game is to make notes of what you did, what went well etc. It’s also designed to help track the performance of decks.

The project is moving on slowly as it’s very much a project of learning where my design dissections and techniques have changed as I’ve learnt and read more.
